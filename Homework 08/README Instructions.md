# Homework 08

For this homework, you will build upon your Homework 07. In fact, you will show
with a few modifications, the code you wrote for Homework 07 can be used to
in a different context for a complex program. 

## Provided Code and Files
* [doc_view.py](../src/doc_view.py) - Provided as is, no need to edit. This is a console view that was the default in Homework07
* [word_lib.py](../src/word_lib.py) - Use your Homework 07 word_lib. We won't be testing this file, so if your word_lib is not working correctly, you will be fine using the 'dummy' (incorrect) version provided.
* [doc_stats_builder.py](../src/doc_stats_builder.py) - Use your Homework 07 doc_stats_builder.  We won't be testing this file, so if your doc_stats_builder is not working correctly, you will be fine using the 'dummy' (incorrect) version provided.
* [doc_stats.py](../src/doc_stats.py) - The main 'driver' for the program. You will modify this file to handle command line arguments in addition to the previous capabilities. Based on the arguments, your program functionality will change from dealing with command line input to reading and writing files. 
* [doc_file_view.py](../src/doc_file_view.py) - Contains functions to help with file reading and writing. While not truly a unique 'view', presented this way to help students see different entry and exit points for their application. 

### Test Files
We have also provided a couple text files to help test your program with. You should also probably create your own files. 

* [haiku.txt](../data/haiku.txt) - A haiku poem
* [auto_generated.txt](../data/auto_generated.txt) - A file generated by chatGPT.

## Part 1: doc_file_view.py

This file has three functions for you to implement. It is highly suggested you implement and test every function, even though two of them involve reading and writing to files! 

One additional concept to know, but not required to understand in depth is JSON format. JSON is a way to store data in a string (and thus a text file). It is a very common format used online for transferring of data between websites and servers. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Javascript is a programming language that is used in web browsers, while python is commonly used at the server level. For example, a python program running Flask or Django may process some data, and then 'serve' that data to a website via JSON string. The web application will then use Javascript to parse that data and display it to the user using HTML. You can learn more about JSON (but don't worry about it for this homework!) [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).

For this homework, what you need to understand is that `stats_to_json` takes a `tuple` and converts the values to a formatted string of the format:


```
{"lines": 1, "words": 2, "vowels": 3, "palindromes": 4, "sentence_palindromes": 5}
```
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - being the values of the tuple (so the parts that change). 

> [!CAUTION]
> You should NOT be using the built in json library or dictionaries (which the json library prefers to work with) to accomplish this, or your code will break when we pass in a tuple. 

### Testing Reading and Writing Files
To test functions that read and write files, you need sample files to read and write. As such, for your tests, you should create a 'solution' file, and then see if your code writes out the same. For example, we can do the following:

```sample_solution.txt
{"lines": 1, "words": 2, "vowels": 3, "palindromes": 4, "sentence_palindromes": 5}
```

Then in our test, we do the following 

```python
write_json_file((1,2,3,4,5), "my_sample_test.txt")
```

We then compare the differences between sample_solution.txt and my_sample_test.txt. You can do this visually.

> [!TIP]  
> `diff` is a command you have on the command line to compare to two files.
> The usage is as follows: `diff file1 file2` in mac and linux or `diff (cat file1) (cat file2)` in windows. You can also use [online diff tools](https://www.diffchecker.com/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For grading purposes, we need to see some sample files you created, and the output of your tests. You can store your sample files in the data directory.


# Part 2: doc_stats.py

In doc_stats, you will be looking at command line arguments modifying how your program runs. For example:

```bash
python doc_stats.py
```
Will do the typical run you saw in Homework 07 asking for client input, and printing out to the terminal. 

```bash
python doc_stats.py -f haiku.txt
```
Will run your program, but instead of reading from the command line, it will read from the file haiku.txt. 


```bash
python doc_stats.py -f haiku.txt -o haiku_stats.txt
```
Will run your program, but instead of reading from the command line, it will read from the file haiku.txt, and write the output to haiku_stats.txt. 

```bash
python doc_stats.py -h
```
Will print out a help message (and is already completed for you).

Your job is to handle the `-f filename` and `-o filename` arguments, along with updating
the main to change how the program flows based on list of strings passed into main. MAKE SURE to look at the weekly team activity provided code!

### Testing
As this is a console application, you can test it by running it with various command line arguments.  You can also add tests by calling functions directly, as for most of them the output is the same given a set of inputs as most are just returning bools and strings!  If you want to use doctest, make sure to add the Examples section to the docstrings, and document that you ran doctest. 


## Report.md and README.md

:fire: **Task**: Answer the questions in the [Report.md](../Report.md) and [README.md](../README.md) files.

As always you are free to ask about the questions in MS Teams, including clarifications on the code.

## Coding Practice
Looking at the coding [practice problems](https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/Resources/blob/main/PracticeProblems.md) in the class resources, you should ideally do a few
others on your own to get more practice coding.  However, you need to submit at least ONE (1)
completed practice as its own python file (which means even if the coding practice had an online
form to fill out like codingbat, you need to copy your solution to a python file).
 
## 🤖 Use of LLMs
You should **not** use LLMs for writing your code. This is about learning the process, and without learning the process you may find it actually more difficult to generate code with LLMs. This is because the prompts for LLMs need to be exact, or they will make faulty assumptions about the code you are trying to generate (often generating incorrect test cases!). This is especially true, as you will want to practice recursion, so you can
better understand it when it is used to traverse data structures. 

You are free to use LLMs to help you think of edge cases  **after** you have a working function. An example prompt could be:

> Please evaluate the following function focusing on these specific areas:
>
> 1. **Code correctness**: Does the implementation match the docstring description?
> 2. **Docstring completeness**: Are the parameters, return value, and examples clear and accurate?
> 3. **Edge cases**: What boundary conditions or unusual inputs could cause issues?
>
> Note that for this function, I am specifically required to use recursion. 
> 
> For any edge cases you identify:
> - Explain why they're problematic
> - Show what would happen with specific input examples
> - Suggest how to handle them (documentation or code changes)
>
> Focus your feedback on the most important issues first. Assume this is for a beginner programming course.
>
> [then paste in the single function you are looking at]

You can also try to use LLMs to generate data, but often the data generated is a bit questionable. 

**Random Text File Generator with Palindromes Prompt**
> I need you to generate a text file containing random words with specific characteristics that I can customize. Please create a file that meets my requirements and then provide a summary of the file's statistics.
>
> **File Requirements:**
> - Generate random words (mix of real words and made-up words is fine)
> - Include at least [X] palindromes (words that read the same forwards and backwards, like "radar", "level", "mom")
> - Organize words across multiple lines (not all on one line)
> - Make the content varied and interesting to work with
>
> **Customizable Parameters (specify your desired values):**
> - **Minimum palindromes**: [specify number, e.g., 8]
> - **Target line count**: [specify number, e.g., 15-20 lines]
> - **Approximate word count**: [specify range, e.g., 100-150 words]
> - **Word length variety**: [specify preference, e.g., "mix of short and long words" or "mostly 3-7 letter words"]
> - **Content style**: [specify type, e.g., "completely random", "nature-themed", "everyday objects", or "mixed themes"]
>
> **Output Format:**
> 1. First, provide the generated text file content (formatted as a code block so I can easily copy it)
> 2. Then provide a statistics summary including:
>    - **Line count**: [actual number]
>    - **Word count**: [actual number]
>    - **Vowel count**: [total vowels a,e,i,o,u across all words]
>    - **Palindrome count**: [actual number found]
>    - **List of palindromes**: [show which words are palindromes]
>
> **Example request format:**
> "Generate a file with at least 6 palindromes, around 80-100 words, 12-15 lines, mixed word lengths, nature-themed content."
>
> This generated file can be used for programming exercises involving file reading, string manipulation, counting operations, and text analysis practice.
>

> [!CAUTION]
> It is often good to ask the LLM to double check the results, as often the initial answers are wrong in situations like this. I would suggest small files, where you can manually confirm the results than larger ones. 

Here is one for learning about file handling.

**Python File Reading Examples Prompt**
> I am learning how to read files in Python and need clear examples with explanations. Can you show me different ways to read files in Python, starting from the most basic approach and building up to more advanced techniques? Please provide:
>
> **Examples I want to see:**
> - Basic file reading (opening, reading, closing)
> - Using the `with` statement for file handling
> - Reading entire files vs. reading line by line
> - Different read methods (read(), readline(), readlines())
> - Handling different file types (text files, CSV files, etc.)
> - Error handling when files don't exist or can't be opened
> - Reading files with different encodings if relevant
>
> **For each example, please explain:**
> - The syntax and what each part does
> - When you would use this approach over others
> - Common mistakes beginners make with this method
> - Any important considerations (memory usage, performance, best practices)
> - What happens step-by-step when the code runs
>
> **Additional guidance I need:**
> - Which approach is considered "best practice" and why
> - How to handle common file reading errors gracefully
> - Tips for working with large files vs. small files
> - How to debug file reading issues when things go wrong
>
> Please structure your examples from simplest to more complex, and include sample file content so I can understand what the code would actually do. Make the examples practical - the kind of file reading tasks I might actually need to do as a beginner programmer.
